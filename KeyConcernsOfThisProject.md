# Introduction #

The main purpose of this project is to also allow people who are not necessarily code gurus to contribute to making a gadget better (in this case, Calculator).


# Details #

You can help by reporting bugs, suggesting features or feature improvements, and by testing product builds. For stuff that doesn't fit into the Downloads, Wiki or Issues sections from the menu on the top, there also are 2 groups where we can discuss: a [user group](http://groups.google.com/group/Google-Desktop-Plugin-GoogleCalculator) dedicated to the gadget, and a [developer group](http://groups.google.com/group/google-calculator) dedicated to it.
