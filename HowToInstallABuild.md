# Introduction #

A build is just a fancy name for a new, usually untested, version of the gadget.


# Details #

You can download new builds from the Downloads section, and if you have [Google Desktop](http://www.desktop.google.com) installed, all you need to do is launch the .gg file. When they start to add up, become more stable and issues are getting resolved, the [official web page](http://desktop.google.com/plugins/i/googlecalculator.html?hl=en) will update the available .gg file to the wide public.
