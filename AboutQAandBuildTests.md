How they want :) We just have to keep it organized.

There really are no restraints to testing and where to report them. If you want to test, it's recommended that you test the latest build in the Downloads section. You can report bugs or suggest features in the Issues section, as well as comment for existing issues if somebody else already submitted them.

I will try and differentiate QA from the actual testing. It should be very important, and goes beyond specific issue testing. QA usually stands for Quality Assurance in this context, but we also have to think of it as Questions (we ask) and Answers (only users will give).
